# Gemini API Compass Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development journey for the Gemini API Compass project. We welcome contributions in any of these areas!

## Project Vision

Create a comprehensive, community-driven resource for Google's Gemini API that:

1. Catalogs common errors with version-aware solutions
2. Provides real-world integration examples beyond simple demos 
3. Includes version migration guides with complete code examples
4. Features cross-API comparison for developers transitioning from other LLM APIs

## Current Status (Phase 1: Documentation Foundation)

We have established the core repository structure with initial documentation:

- Version comparison documentation for v1, v1beta, v1alpha
- Initial error catalog covering common issues
- Example code demonstrating version-specific usage patterns
- Basic cross-API comparison guidelines
- Contribution guidelines and issue templates

## Short-Term Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### Documentation Expansion

- **Error Catalog Growth**: Add at least 10 more common errors with solutions
- **Version Documentation**: Complete guides for all API versions (v1, v1beta, v1alpha)
- **Version Comparison Tables**: Create comprehensive feature comparison matrices

### Code Example Development

- **Multimodal Examples**: Demonstrate image input capabilities
- **Function Calling Examples**: Showcase tool use implementations
- **Chat Implementation Patterns**: Multi-turn conversation examples 
- **Streaming Response Handling**: Efficient streaming implementation examples

### Migration Guides

- **Complete OpenAI → Gemini Guide**: Comprehensive comparison and migration steps
- **Add Anthropic → Gemini Guide**: Claude-specific migration patterns
- **Enhance v1beta → v1 Migration**: Detailed upgrade path documentation

## Medium-Term Goals (2-5 Months)

### Community Contributions 

- Implement robust contribution guidelines and templates
- Create "good first issues" for new contributors
- Establish review process for community submissions
- Recognize and highlight valuable contributions

### Extended Documentation

- Create "recipes" for common usage patterns
- Add performance optimization guides
- Document best practices for reliability and resilience
- Expand troubleshooting documentation

### Content Development

- Create tutorials based on repository content
- Develop reference implementations for common use cases
- Build interactive examples where possible
- Construct comprehensive testing examples

## Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months)

### Phase 1: Documentation Repository (Current)
Focus on building comprehensive documentation organized by version and use case.

### Phase 2: Community Contributions (Months 3-5)
Transform into a collaborative platform that leverages community expertise.

### Phase 3: Advanced Functionality (Months 6-12)
Explore tooling and automation to enhance the developer experience.
